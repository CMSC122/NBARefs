# NBARefs
A repository with our CS122 Project about NBA refereeing

The compressed file NBA.tar.gz contains the large folder that configures the website. I was able to unzip the file on my VM to get the folder so hopefully that shouldn't be a problem. There is another README in that folder to explain how to get to the website.
